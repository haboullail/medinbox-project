# ðŸ“¦ Medinbox Equipment Management App

This full stack project was developed as part of the Medinbox technical test.  
It is a layered web application for managing medical equipment, featuring real-time updates and role-based access control.  
The focus was on clean code, scalability, and maintainability.

## Project Overview

The backend is built following a **Clean Architecture** pattern, with well-separated concerns:

- **Domain layer**: core business logic and entities
- **Application layer**: interfaces, DTOs, and services
- **Infrastructure layer**: EF Core persistence and data access
- **WebAPI layer**: REST API with JWT authentication and middleware

The frontend is built with Angular + PrimeNG, and a lightweight WebSocket server in Node.js handles real-time communication.
